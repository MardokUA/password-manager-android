   TODO: 04.12.2021 generally, it's a good idea to place all dependencies in such class.
         Nevertheless, seems to me you made it too shattered, in the other words - overcomplicated.
         You have a lot of classes with 3-5 rows. I've got the idea and totally understand why you moved
         in this way, but it still to much, as for me.
